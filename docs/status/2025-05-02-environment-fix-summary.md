# Environment and Documentation Fixes

- **Environment**: CLI

## Summary of Activities

Today we conducted maintenance work focusing on improving environment tests and project documentation. We addressed several key issues with the project's environment setup, testing capabilities, and documentation standards.

## Key Updates

1. **Environment Test Fixes**
   - Fixed the `env_test.hy` file to use the correct import path `google.genai` instead of `google.generativeai`
   - Updated the Makefile's `env-test` target to use the Hy runner with the correct file path
   - Enabled verification that the Google API environment is properly configured

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Fixed the `test-genai` target in the Makefile to use the Hy runner
   - Updated `test_genai.hy` to use correct imports and fixed a syntax error in f-string handling
   - Improved masking of API key in test output for better security

3. **Documentation**
   - Enhanced `CLAUDE.org` documentation with comprehensive guidance
   - Added clear instructions for running single tests for both Python and Hy files
   - Expanded the Hy code style section with more specific guidelines

## Code Quality Improvements

Our implementation enforced the project's coding standards:
- Used kebab-case for Hy function and variable names
- Corrected imports to use the project's designated "ONE TRUE WAY" pattern
- Used proper error handling with try/except blocks
- Maintained lisp-style organization with appropriate comments

## Commit Standards

All commits adhered to the project's Git commit standards:
- Used Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Added appropriate Co-Authored-By and Reviewed-By trailers
- Maintained clear, concise commit messages explaining the purpose of changes

## Repository Health

The project is now in a more stable state:
- Environment tests pass successfully
- GenAI tests run successfully (though some API methods need updates)
- Documentation accurately reflects the project's structure and requirements
- Makefile targets correctly handle both Python and Hy files

## Next Steps

Future work could address:
1. Update the embedding API methods in test_genai.hy to match the current API
2. Add more comprehensive test coverage for the various Hy modules
3. Consider adding automated validation for import style consistency
