Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jason, joining from Boston. My background is in software engineering with 5+ years of experience building web applications and APIs.

I've done some preliminary work with LLMs and fine-tuning, but I'm excited to dive deeper into generative AI and specifically how to effectively use Google's Gemini models for practical applications.

I'm particularly interested in:
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks
- Building reliable systems with LLMs

Looking forward to learning with all of you over the next 5 days!
