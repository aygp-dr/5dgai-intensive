To fully participate in all Kaggle Discord channels, your Kaggle account needs to be linked to Discord:

1. Visit: https://kaggle.com/discord/confirmation
2. Review the permissions:
   - Discord will be able to access:
     - Your Kaggle username and display name
     - Your progression tier
     - Your signup date
   - Discord will NOT have access to your Kaggle password
   - You can revoke access anytime in Kaggle Account Settings
3. Click "Link your account to Discord"
4. Verify the connection by checking access to additional Discord channels

#+begin_note
This step can only be completed after your Kaggle phone verification is successful, as the account linking requires a verified Kaggle account.
#+end_note

Benefits of linking:
- Access to all channels in the Kaggle Discord server
- Ability to participate in community discussions beyond the course-specific channels
- Your Kaggle achievements/progression will be visible in Discord
