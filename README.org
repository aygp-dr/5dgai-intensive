* Course Overview

Welcome to the Google's 5-Day Generative AI Intensive course companion repository! This toolkit helps you:

- üöÄ Hit the ground running with pre-configured environments
- üîå Connect to Google AI Studio APIs quickly with minimal setup
- üìä Focus on learning instead of debugging environment issues
- üìù Keep your notes organized by course day
- üîç Explore bonus examples beyond what's covered in the course

*Note*: While the official course uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks, this repository 
takes a different approach using *Hy* (a Lisp dialect that runs on Python) and *Org-mode* 
for literate programming. The core functionality and concepts remain the same, but with 
the elegance of Lisp syntax and the power of Org-mode's tangling capabilities.

* What You'll Learn in the Course

- *Day 1*: Foundations of Generative AI and Gemini models
- *Day 2*: Prompt engineering techniques and best practices
- *Day 3*: Building with Gemini API and fine-tuning models
- *Day 4*: Multimodal applications and responsible AI
- *Day 5*: Production deployment and advanced use cases

* Quick Start Guide

** Setup your environment
   #+begin_src sh
   # Using the setup script (recommended)
   ./setup.sh
   
   # Or manually with Poetry
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   #+end_src

** Configure your API keys
   Edit the ~.env~ file to add your API keys:
   #+begin_src sh
   AI_STUDIO_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   KAGGLE_USERNAME="your-username"
   KAGGLE_KEY="your-key"
   # Optional keys for additional exercises
   OPENAI_API_KEY=""
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
   #+end_src

** Open Org-mode Notebooks
   #+begin_src sh
   # Using Emacs (recommended)
   emacs notebooks/day1/01-introduction.org
   
   # Or view with any text editor
   less notebooks/day1/01-introduction.org
   
   # To tangle code from a specific notebook
   make tangle FILE=notebooks/day1/01-introduction.org
   
   # To tangle all notebooks and build source files
   make build
   #+end_src

** Test your API connectivity
   #+begin_src sh
   # Quick validation of your Gemini API setup
   make api-test
   #+end_src

* Repository Tools & Features

- *Gemini API Client*: Ready-to-use Hy/Python interface to Google's Gemini models
- *Org-mode Notebooks*: Organized by course day for easy learning & tangling
- *Restclient Integration*: Direct API testing in Org-mode with ob-restclient
- *IPython Support*: Enhanced REPL experience for both Python and Hy
- *Resource Collection*: Papers, references, and supplementary materials
- *Docker Integration*: Containerized environment to avoid compatibility issues
- *Automated Testing*: Verify API connectivity with a single command

* Core Features Demonstrated

- Text generation with Gemini
- Chat conversations and context management
- Prompt engineering techniques
- System instructions and parameter tuning
- Multimodal inputs (coming in day 4)
- RAG implementation examples

* Using the Gemini Client

Our simplified client makes it easy to interact with Gemini models in both Hy and Python:

#+begin_src hy
(import [src.gemini-client [GeminiClient]])

;; Initialize with API key from .env file
(setv client (GeminiClient))

;; Simple text generation
(setv response (.generate-content client 
    "Explain the concept of attention in transformer models."))
(print (.extract-text client response))

;; Chat conversation
(setv messages [
    {"role" "user" "content" "What are three applications of generative AI?"}
    {"role" "model" "content" "1. Content creation\n2. Code generation\n3. Data augmentation"}
    {"role" "user" "content" "Elaborate on code generation use cases."}
])
(setv chat-response (.chat client messages))
(print (.extract-text client chat-response))
#+end_src

Python version for reference:

#+begin_src python
from src.gemini_client import GeminiClient

# Initialize with API key from .env file
client = GeminiClient()

# Simple text generation
response = client.generate_content(
    "Explain the concept of attention in transformer models."
)
print(client.extract_text(response))

# Chat conversation
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are three applications of generative AI?"},
    {"role": "model", "content": "1. Content creation\n2. Code generation\n3. Data augmentation"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Elaborate on code generation use cases."}
]
chat_response = client.chat(messages)
print(client.extract_text(chat_response))
#+end_src
