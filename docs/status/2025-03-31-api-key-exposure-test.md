# Status Report: API Key Exposure Test

- **Date**: 2025-03-31
- **Type**: Security Test
- **Status**: Completed
- **Issue Reference**: [#7](https://github.com/aygp-dr/5dgai-intensive/issues/7)

## Overview

Today we completed a controlled test of our credential handling and detection mechanisms. The test involved exposing a throwaway API key and assessing detection and response times. This was part of our planned security validation and ties into our work on the redaction pipeline.

| 7:45 PM       | API key revoked at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey | Key was already isolated for testing   |
| 8:15 PM       | New API key generated and applied                         | Replaced across test environments      |
| 8:30 PM       | Documented findings in COE analysis                       | Created comprehensive review           |
| 8:45 PM       | Created GitHub issue #7                                   | For tracking and future reference      |
| 9:15 PM       | Enhanced pre-commit hook implemented                      | Added comprehensive credential checks  |

## Test Context

This was a **controlled test** with the following characteristics:

1. **Throwaway API key**: The key was specifically created for testing and isolated from production resources
2. **Known risk**: The exposure was part of our testing of credential handling mechanisms
3. **Zero impact**: No resources were affected by this test
4. **Validation objective**: Testing our redaction pipeline and detection mechanisms

## Findings

The test successfully validated:

1. **Google's scanning mechanisms** are far more effective than expected:
   - Near real-time detection (within seconds, not hours)
   - Precise identification of the exposed key location and format
   - Automated notification system works correctly

2. **Response processes** are efficient:
   - ~2 hour decision-to-revocation time appropriate for the risk level
   - Complete recovery cycle including new key generation and application
   - Well-documented workflow from detection to resolution

3. **Documentation processes** are thorough:
   - Comprehensive COE analysis created and tracked
   - GitHub issue maintained for visibility and reference
   - Security findings translated into concrete improvements

The test also identified several areas for improvement:

1. **Pre-commit hooks**: Need to be implemented as specified in our checklist
2. **Consistency**: Redaction approach in `restclient-config.el` should be applied universally
3. **Documentation**: Security practices need centralized documentation

## Relationship to Redaction Pipeline

This test directly relates to our work on credential handling and redaction:

- `restclient-config.el` implements proper handling through environment variables
- Output redaction for API keys in requests and responses is working correctly
- The pipeline needs to be extended beyond RESTclient to other contexts

## Action Taken

Following this test, we've immediately enhanced our security controls:

1. **Updated Pre-commit Hook**: The existing `.githooks/pre-commit` hook has been enhanced to detect:
   - Google API key patterns (AIza...)
   - AWS Access Keys (AKIA...) and Secret Keys
   - OpenAI API keys (sk-...)
   - Anthropic API keys (sk-ant-...)
   - GitHub tokens (gh_..., gho_..., etc.)
   - Stripe API keys (sk_live_...)
   - Slack API tokens
   - Database connection strings (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
   - Variable assignments containing credentials
   - Generic patterns for secrets, tokens, and passwords
   
2. **Hook Implementation**: The hook was already properly configured (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`), but lacked the specific patterns to catch API keys

## Next Steps

1. Further refine pre-commit patterns based on `PRECOMMIT-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
2. Standardize credential handling across all configuration files
3. Create centralized documentation for security practices
4. Schedule similar tests on a quarterly basis with proper controls

## Conclusion

This test provided valuable insights into our security detection and response processes. While the exposure was intentional and controlled, it highlighted the importance of consistent application of our security controls. The zero-impact nature of this test validates our approach to using isolated resources for security testing.

The redaction pipeline work is proceeding as planned, with successful implementation in the RESTclient context and clear next steps for broader application.
