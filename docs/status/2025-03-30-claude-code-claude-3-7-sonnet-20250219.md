## Content Filtering Error

While creating the repository structure, we encountered a content filtering policy error when attempting to create or reference a Code of Conduct file. 

### Error Details

```
API Error: {"type":"error","error":{"details":null,"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Output blocked by content filtering policy"}}
```

This error occurred when processing the text:
```
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
```

### Analysis

The error appears to be a false positive in the content filtering system. The mention of a Code of Conduct document, which is a standard GitHub repository file, triggered the filtering mechanism despite containing no problematic content.

### Workaround

To work around this issue:
1. Removed direct references to the Code of Conduct file
2. Modified repository setup to focus on technical documentation only
3. Documented the error for future reference

### Recommendations

If you need to include a Code of Conduct:
- Create it manually outside of Claude Code
- Consider using GitHub's template system
- Alternatively, reference external Code of Conduct resources without creating a local file

## Other Observations

No other filtering issues were encountered during repository setup. All other common GitHub repository files (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, issue templates) were created successfully.
