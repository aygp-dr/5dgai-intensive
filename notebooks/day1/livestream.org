*** Key Points
- Suggested listening: NotebookLLM podcast (noted as "just trolling")
- Discussion topics:
  + Agent versioning and testing
  + Comprehensive SDK coverage 
  + Deep analysis approaches
  + 1-3 year speculation deemed unnecessary
  + Evaluation flows and quality criteria
  + Context considerations

*** Technical Aspects
- Prompt caching implementation
- Batch APIs and fixed requirements
- Idle compute utilization
- Energy efficiency optimization

*** Organizational Challenges
- Rapid rate of change will be difficult for organizations to adapt to

*** Questions & Comments
- "This is an interesting question" (specific question not noted)
- Excessive speculation about LLM background noted as unnecessary

*** Action Items
- Consider having AI listen to the stream for better notes
- Follow up on evaluation criteria discussion

day 1: notes and instrctions 

- asked people to listten to the notebookllm podcaast which is just trolling 
- agent versioning and testing 
- covering all of the sdkk
- deep analysis 
- nonsennse about 1-3 y specutiionnn is unnecessary ; not worth listtening 
- need to have the ai listen to the stream 
- so much speculation about background for teh llm, why do people 
- eval flows noted/ what are the criteria of what is good 
- conntext vs. something else 
- rate of change will be difficult for orgs
- "this is an intereint questino" 
- prommpt caching 
- batch apis / fixed reqirements 
- look at idle compute 
- flatten out / energy efficiency 
- use prompt engineerng and criteria and judge criteria
- asking questions at the end look like a sales pitch 
- had dean at the start talking about excitement
- really, the notebook llm as 
- rlhf should be reward model ; this quiz approach is like asking about what the model foxus attention on so it's about learning the tone
