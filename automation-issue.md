# Automation for Documentation Standards Testing

## Problem Statement
We've spent significant time manually testing Claude Code's adherence to documentation standards. Each test requires:
1. Running `/init` with a new session
2. Checking if the agent respects our .org documentation standard
3. Manually updating test results in multiple files
4. Committing changes to git

This is time-consuming and difficult to scale to the desired 20 test runs.

## Proposed Solution
Create an automated testing script that:
1. Launches Claude Code in headless mode
2. Runs the `/init` command
3. Evaluates the output for attempts to create a CLAUDE.md file
4. Records test results automatically
5. Updates necessary documentation files with test statistics
6. Commits and pushes results

## Technical Approach
- Use the Claude API directly or headless browser automation
- Record session outputs and parse for relevant activities
- Implement result tracking logic to update statistics
- Automate git operations when tests complete

## Confidence Assessment
**Automation Confidence: Medium-High (65-80%)**

Reasons for confidence:
- Claude API or automation tools are mature enough to script interactions
- Pattern matching to detect Markdown creation is straightforward
- File updates and git operations are easily scriptable

Challenges:
- Headless interaction with Claude Code may require special permissions
- Pattern matching could miss subtle variants of the issue
- API rate limits may restrict rapid testing

## Timeline
- Investigation and proof of concept: 2-3 days
- Initial implementation: 1 week
- Refinement and reliability improvements: 1 week

## Next Steps
1. Determine if Claude Code has an API or headless mode for testing
2. Create a proof-of-concept script for a single test run
3. Extend to batch processing for multiple tests
4. Implement a reporting dashboard for test results
