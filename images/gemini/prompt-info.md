## Prompt Used for 5-Day Gen AI Course Images

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a vibrant, engaging header image for a GitHub repository about a '5-Day Gen AI Intensive' course using Google's Gemini models. Aspect ratio 16:5. Use a light background suitable for light/dark mode interfaces, incorporating subtle geometric patterns and blurred code-like elements. Feature abstract neural network patterns flowing across the image in blues, purples, and teals (Google AI colors). Include the text '5-Day Gen AI Intensive' in a clean, modern sans-serif font, prominently displayed. Integrate small, recognizable icons for Python and Jupyter notebooks. Show a clear progression theme for the 5 days using a sequence of small, distinct icons: Day 1 (foundation block/simple shape), Day 2 (prompt/speech bubble with gear), Day 3 (API connection/nodes), Day 4 (multimodal symbols like text/image/sound), Day 5 (deployment/cloud with arrow). The overall style should be modern, tech-focused, professional but approachable, balanced, and not cluttered.",
